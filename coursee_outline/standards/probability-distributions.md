## Standards for Probability Distributions
Students should be able to
 * (H) Define a “random variable” and give real-world examples.
 * (H) State Bayes’ law and name the terms.
 * (MH) Explain the difference between probability and statistics.
 * (MH) Identify whether two random variables are independent.
 * (MH) Give the difference between discrete and continuous distributions.
 * (M) Given examples of joint and conditional probability.
 * (M) Calculate the number of possible outcomes using combinatorics from factorials.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
