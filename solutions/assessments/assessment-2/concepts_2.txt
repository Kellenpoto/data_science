The bias of a coin is 0.6. What is the probability of flipping 8 or 
more heads in 10 flips?

    ``` python 
    import scipy.stats as scs

    rv = scs.binom(10, 0.6)

    rv.pmf(8) + rv.pmf(9) + rv.pmf(10)

    0.1672897536 
    ```


What is P(x=T | y=b)?

  Since y=b, we need the relative probability that x=T within column 
  "b", i.e., 
  
  (0.1) / (0.1 + 0.15) = 0.4
  
You have a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 4. 
Calculate P(1 < x < 2 ∪ 3.5 < x < 4).

P(1 < x < 2) = 1/4*(2-1)
P(3.5 < x < 4) = 1/4(4-3.5)
0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375

Difference between PDF and PMF?
Is the data continuous or discrete?   
If the data is discrete, you have a PMF.   
If the data is continuous, you have a PDF.

You’re flipping an unfair coin 5 times and seeing how many times it comes up heads in those 5 flips.
distribution.pmf(2) = 0.3394
distribution.pdf(3): AttributeError
distribution.cdf(5) = 1.0

Which distribution is most appropriate to use to represent the scenario? 

The side that faces up when you roll a fair, 20 sided die: Uniform, Discrete
In a fair die, each side is equally likely to face up. This is a uniform distribution. It is discrete because we can only have integer values (1,2,3, etc.).

Whether or not a fair, 20 sided die will roll a 15 or greater: Bernoulli
The Bernoulli distribution is used to describe a single trial that can have two outcomes: success or failure.

You roll five of the 20 sided dice and want to know how many will roll a 15 or greater: Binomial
The binomial distribution is used to predict the outcome of several Bernoulli (success/fail) trials.

Busses arrive at a rate of 12 per hour. What is the probability 15 or more busses will arrive in the next hour? Poisson
The Poisson distribution is used to predict number of events that occur.

Busses arrive at a rate of 12 per hour. How long do you expect to wait until the next bus arrives? Exponential
The exponential distribution is used to predict the wait time until the very first event. 
(Compare to the gamma distribution, which is used to predict the wait time until the k-th event).
