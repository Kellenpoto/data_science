## Standards for Gradient Descent
Students should be able to
 * (MH) Explain how derivatives can be used to find a local minimum.
 * (MH) Discuss the challenges of and approaches to finding global minima.
 * (M) Explain how gradient descent can diverge.
 * (M) Write pseudocode of the gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms.
 * (M) Compare and contrast gradient descent with stochastic gradient descent.
 * (ML) Describe several alternatives to gradient descent.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
