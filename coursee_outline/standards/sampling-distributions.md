## Standards for Sampling Distributions
Students should be able to
 * (H) Give real-world examples of common distributions (bernoulli, binomial, geometric, poisson, normal, uniform, exponential, gamma).
 * (MH) Use common methods on scipy distributions (rvs, pdf, pmf, cdf, ppf).
 * (MH) Calculate the expectation value of a function of a discrete random variable.
 * (MH) Use the Law of Large Numbers and a sample to estimate an expectation value.
 * (MH) Calculate the mean, variance, and covariances from a sample.
 * (MH) Generate bootstrap samples from a sample.
 * (M) Calculate the expectation value of a function of a continuous random variable.
 * (M) Use Bootstrap samples to estimate a confidence interview.
 * (L) Calculate the sample (non-biased) variance from a sample.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
