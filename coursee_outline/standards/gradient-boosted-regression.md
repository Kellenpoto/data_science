## Standards for Gradient Boosted Regression
Students should be able to
 * (H) Use sklearn GB for regression and classification.
 * (MH) Describe DT hyperparameters, number-of-estimators, and subsample for GB and state which direction will increase bias, and which will increase variance.
 * (MH) Describe how the learning rate and number of estimators are related in GB.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
