## Standards for Convolutional Neural Nets
Students should be able to
 * (MH) Explain the advantage of a CNN relative to an MLP for image modelling.
 * (MH) List several use cases for CNNs.
 * (M) Describe the function, shape, and arrangement of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers in a CNN.
 * (M) Calculate the convolution of an image kernel and a grayscale image by hand.
 * (M) Use keras to create and fine-tune a simple CNN.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
