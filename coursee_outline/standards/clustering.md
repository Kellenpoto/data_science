## Standards for Clustering
Students should be able to
 * (H) Write pseudocode for the k-means algorithm
 * (MH) Use the elbow and silhouette score method to determine the number of clusters.
 * (M) Interpret clusters by examining cluster centers, and exploring the data within each cluster.
 * (M) Explain how repeated attempts and kmeans++ can find a global minimum.
 * (M) Build and interpret a dendrogram using hierarchical clustering.
 * (M) Describe the four types of linkage in hierarchical clustering.
 * (M) Compare and contrast k-means and hierarchical clustering.
 * (M) Describe the difference betwen hard and soft clustering.
 * (ML) Describe how distribution-based clustering can be solved with an expectation-maximization algorithm.
 * (L) Interpret a Silhouette plot
 * (L) Describe DBSCAN clustering.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
