## Standards for Inferential Regression
Students should be able to
 * (MH) Identify whether a problem involves inferential or predictive regression.
 * (MH) List the key assumptions of inferential regression.
 * (MH) Perform and interpret a linear-regression hypothesis test with statsmodels.
 * (M) Test if the assumptions of inferential regression are met on a data set.
 * (M) Transform a data set to meet the assumptions of inferential regression.
 * (ML) Perform and interpret a logistic-regression hypothesis test with statsmodels.
 * (ML) Use AIC/BIC to choose the best regression model.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
