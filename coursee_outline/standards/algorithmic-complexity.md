## Standards for Algorithmic Complexity
Students should be able to
 * (M) Explain why and how computational complexity is useful.
 * (M) Identify the computational complexity of a function of O(1), O(n), or O(n**2).
 * (M) State the computational complexity of common list and dict methods.
 * (ML) Describe why worst-case complexity can be important.
 * (ML) Identity the computational complexity of a function of O(log(n)), O(n log(n)), or (2**n).

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
