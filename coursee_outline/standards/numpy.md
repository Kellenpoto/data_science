## Standards for Numpy
Students should be able to
 * (H) Create arrays from python lists and from lists of lists.
 * (H) Index an array using single values or slices (basic indexing).
 * (H) Find the shape of an array and explain what it means.
 * (H) Create arrays to specifications using np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.arange(), and np.linspace().
 * (MH) Use reshape with -1 as an argument to add a dimension to an array.
 * (MH) State if two given two arrays can be broadcast together, and the final shape.
 * (M) Use the axis parameter on numpy functions.
 * (M) Use argmax and argsort to find values in one array based upon values from a corresponding array.
 * (M) Index an array using another array (advanced indexing).

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
