# This file contains a list of repos that fast-evolving libraries are used.
# Periodic examination is recommended to ensure the runnability and correctness of these materials.
# It is recommended to upgrade the syntax and format of those materials to the latest as well.
# The names of the repos follow the convention as the first column of descriptions.csv.
# Some packages changed historically but it is unlikely that they are going to change significantly again. 
# These packages are not included. 
# One example is scikit-learn whose APIs changed fairly quickly in the past but not now.
# requirements.txt is required for these repos.  


repositoary_name, involved_packages, chance_of_change, notes    
perceptrons, tensorflow, low, functional syntax is prefered in general though
time-series, statsmodels, low, there was hiden changes of API parameters
convolutional-neural-nets, tensorflow, medium, big changes of dataset module from 1.x to 2.x
nlp, nltk and scikit-learn, low, None
graphs-searching, networkx, low, None
time-series-arima, statismodels, medium, big API changes in the past
recurrent-neural-nets, tensorflow, medium, None 
autoencoders, tensorflow, medium, tensorboard needs special attention
transfer-learning, tensorflow and keras, medium, the keras APIs needs update to tf.keras
reinforcement-learning, tensorflow and keras-rl2, high, currently this repo relies on a historical version of keras-rl2. Implementation from scratch is needed in the long run.
