## Standards for Decision Trees
Students should be able to
 * (H) Use sklearn DT for regression and classification.
 * (H) Describe max depth and other hyperparameters for DT and state which direction will increase bias, and which will increase variance.
 * (MH) Describe DT hyperparameters for RF and state which direction will increase bias, and which will increase variance.
 * (M) Write pseudocode for basic DT.
 * (M) Describe how loss functions relate to DT.
 * (ML) Calculate the purity gain of a DT based on a split.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
