## Standards for Bayes Intro
Students should be able to
 * (H) State Bayes theorem and the identify the prior, likelihood, and posterior, and normalizing constant.
 * (MH) Solve a traditional Bayes theorem example (e.g., probability of disease given positive test)
 * (MH) Use Bayes theorem to update posterior repeatedly with new data points.
 * (M) Compare MLE solutions with Bayesian estimations.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
