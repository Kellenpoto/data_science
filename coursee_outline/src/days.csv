# Weeks descriptions start with a !, comments with a #
# All other non-blank lines are a date followed by zero or more repos
# Repo names are used for both assignments and lectures (these must be the same)
# "Repo" names starting with % are included as strings without links in the Repos column
#   and not in the Lecture Materials columns
# Repo names starting with ! don't have a link in the Lecture Materials columns
# Anything after a / (in a non-% repo name) is a branch,
#   e.g., oop/update will point to github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/oop/tree/update
#   (note the lecture would will still use the campus branch)
# Descriptions are taken from descriptions.csv, readings from resources.csv
