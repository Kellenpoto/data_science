# Welcome %campus% Cohort!

## Welcome to the Galvanize Data Science Immersive!

Make sure you are on the branch of the `course-outline` repository corresponding to your cohort. This README is your primary resource for class activities and contains information about the program as well as links to pre-lecture resources, assignments and lecture materials. **Bookmark this page** and refer to it daily.

#  Weekly overview
The Data Science Immersive (DSI) has a total of 8 instructional weeks, 3 capstone weeks, 1 week-long break (Solo Week) and a final showcase/career week. Instructors will have limited availability during Solo Week.

There is a readiness assessment on Day 1 of the course and six assessments on Mondays following instructional weeks. Most Fridays during instructional weeks are a group case study day.

Capstone weeks are reserved for your capstone projects (see below) and mock job interiews. You will present your capstone 1 and 2 projects to your peers and instructors at the end of the capstone weeks. You will present your capstone 3 project to the data science community at the end of the course.

* [Morning Warmups](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/morning-warmups)
* [Solutions](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/%solutions%) for warmups, assignments and assessments will be added to this repository. If a solution is missing, please tell an instructor!
* [Past student capstone projects](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/project-proposals/blob/master/past_student_projects.md) Take a look for capstone ideas or resources to help you with your current capstone. Exemplary projects are marked with an asterisk.
* [Lectures](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/lectures/tree/%campus%) Links to lecture materials point to this repository. **`git clone` this repository and `git checkout %campus%` to get the materials for your campus. `git pull` regularly to keep synchronized with the latest updates instructors make.**
* [Quick reference](./quick-reference) documents for software and python libraries used in the DSI. `DSI_quick_ref.pdf` contains all the documents in one file but each of the documents is also available individually. The `Git.pdf` is likely to come in handy everyday. The `DSI_Installation_Guide.pdf` is provided if you need to re-install VSCode and Anaconda's distribution of Python.
* [Notes](./notes) Please read about [pair programming](./notes/pairing.md), [program standards](./notes/standards.md) and [development workflow](./notes/workflow.md) during your first week. Instructors may ask you to read additional materials from this directory in the coming weeks.

## Capstone Projects
You will use the knowledge and skills you are gaining in this program to create personal projects of your choosing. You can talk about these projects and the skills you developed through them during job interviews. You will submit capstone proposals to the instructors for approval before the capstone weeks begin. Often, capstone 3 builds on work done in capstone 2 and sometimes even in capstone 1.

## Textbooks
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf): The book we use for the majority of machine learning readings.
* [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf): If ISLR doesn't have enough detail for you, then look in ESL by the same authors.
* [Machine Learning In Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1cm3fV8cnJwcUNWWnFaRWgwTDA/view?usp=sharing)
* [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) Intended as a deep learning text, its introductory treatment of probability, linear algebra and mathematics is excellent.
* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) We introduce forecasting but it's a specialized discipline. This free text expands on the subject.

### Optional Texts
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
* [Doing Data Science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659): One of the best treatments of the field with plenty of case studies.
* [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): Some of the `pandas` methods have changed (always reference `pandas` [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) but a solid book on data analysis in Python.
* [Practical Data Science with R](http://www.manning.com/zumel/): through we will not use R, this is a stellar book for its content and theory.

## Video Series
* [Youtube lectures by Hastie and Tibshirani on Statistical Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V)
* [StatsQuest](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer) - A goofy but clear explanation of statistics and machine learning concepts.
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) Self-described as some combination of math and entertainment, this channel has explanations for many machine learning topics.
