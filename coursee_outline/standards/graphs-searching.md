## Standards for Graphs Searching
Students should be able to
 * (MH) Define graphs and common graph terms (node, edge, directed, connected, weighted, cycle, etc.)
 * (MH) List common applications of graph models.
 * (M) Discuss different data structures for representing graphs (edge list, adjacency list, agency matrix).
 * (M) List use cases for breadth-first and depth-first traversal.
 * (M) Use python packages to build graph data structure in Python and execute common algorithms (shortest path, connected components, â€¦)
 * (ML) Write pseudo code for breadth-first and depth-first traversal.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
