## Standards for Text Classification
Students should be able to
 * (MH) Explain the difference between generative and discriminative models.
 * (MH) Define Laplace smoothing and describe why it's used.
 * (MH) Explain how Naive Bayes is naive.
 * (MH) Use sklearn to implement a Naive Bayes classification model on text.
 * (M) Explain the models that generate text in Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
 * (ML) Use Gaussian Naive Bayes to include continuous features.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
