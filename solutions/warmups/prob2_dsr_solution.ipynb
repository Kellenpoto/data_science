    "2. A hunter has two hunting dogs. One day, on the trail of some animal, the hunter comes to a place where the road diverges into two paths. He knows that each dog, independent of the other, will choose the correct path with probability p. The hunter decides to let each dog choose a path, and if they agree, he takes that one, and if they disagree, he randomly picks a path. Is his strategy better than just letting one of the two dogs decide on a path? Explain why or why not."
