## Standards for Recurrent Neural Nets
Students should be able to
 * (MH) List several use cases for RNNs.
 * (M) Draw the basic structure of an RNN, both with cyclic connection and unrolled in time
 * (M) Describe why a model's ability to maintain a state based is important in time series applications.
 * (M) Use Keras to execute and fine-tune an LSTM in Python.
 * (ML) Explain what exploding and vanishing gradients are, and why they are shortcomings for basic RNNs.
 * (ML) Explain at a high level what an LSTM computational layer is, and how it solves the exploding/vanishing gradient problems.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
