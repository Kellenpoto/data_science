## Standards for Statistical Power
Students should be able to
 * (H) Define power, false-positive rate, standard error, effect size, and critical value, and explain how changing one affects another.
 * (MH) Explain how alpha controls false-positive rate, and beta controls false-negative rate.
 * (M) Calculate the sample size necessary for a particular power and false-positive rate for a test.
 * (M) Draw curves of the null and an alternative hypothesis, showing the critical value, alpha and power.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
