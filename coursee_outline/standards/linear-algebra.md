## Standards for Linear Algebra
Students should be able to
 * (H) Calculate the dot product of vectors by hand and use this to determine the angle between them.
 * (H) Calculate the magnitude and direction of a vector by hand.
 * (H) Calculate matrix multiplication by hand.
 * (MH) Represent a vector as a 1D numpy array, or a 2D array in row or column form.
 * (MH) Transpose a matrix by hand.
 * (M) Calculate the rank for a simple matrix by hand.
 * (M) Explain the equation for eigenvector and eigenvalues.
 * (ML) Give several use cases of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
