## Bayesian Proficiency Estimation

You're working on building a new mastery learning algorithm to decide whether to continue giving students practice problems on a particular concept, based on their current proficiency levels. As a key component of your mastery learning algorithm, you decide to take a Bayesian approach to proficiency estimation.

Suppose we have a test bank of questions on data science. We say that an individual's data science is theta (with respect to our test bank) if she has an independent probability theta of answering any randomly drawn question from the test bank correctly. Suzanne correctly answers 6 out of 8 randomly drawn questions from the test bank. If the prior distribution over Suzanne's data science proficiency is theta ~ Uniform(0,1), then what is the probability that Suzanne will correctly answer the next question from the test bank?
