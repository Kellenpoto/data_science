# Mongo DB

Mongo is a noSQL data storage system.  It's excellent for storing poorly structured data, such as that gathered via web scraping.  

## Objectives
 - Create an instance of a mongo server either in Docker or locally installed
 - Use mongo shell to perform basic operations:
    * Create a db/collection
    * Insert a record
    * Retrieve records
    * Delete a record
 - Connect to Mongo via python, and perform all of the above actions.
