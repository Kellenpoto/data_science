You have a shuffled deck of 60 cards containing the following cards of special interest.  
  - Three of these cards in the deck are marked with a diamond.
  - Three of the cards are marked with a star.  
  - The remaining cards are nothing special.
    You draw an initial hand of five cards, after which you *must* discard any of the star cards for an additional three cards drawn from the top of the deck.  This process is repeated until you find yourself with a hand that does *not* contain any star cards.  Write a simulation to approximate the probability that your initial draw results in a final hand containing a diamond card.
