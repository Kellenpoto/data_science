Git

    a)  What is git, and why do software developers use it? (1 pt)

    Git is a version control software. Developers use it to keep track 
    of changes in their code, work simultaneously with others on large 
    projects, and test changes in code on branches before implementing 
    (merging) them with their main branch, often called 'master.'

    b) What is the 'staging area', or 'index' in git? (1 pt)

    The staging area lets developers add the changes they've made to 
    code before fully 'committing' the code, or adding it to the 
    tracked changes in git.

    c) What does the command 'git commit' do? (1 pt)

    "git commit -m 'your commit message'" will add the files in your 
    staging area or index to your tracked changes. It records changes 
    to the repository.
