## Standards for Regularized Regression
Students should be able to
 * (H) Describe the hyperparameter for regularization with linear regression and state which direction will increase bias, and which will increase variance.
 * (MH) Describe the loss function for Lasso and Ridge regression
 * (MH) Use sklearn for regularized regression.
 * (M) Compare and contrast Lasso and Ridge regression.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
