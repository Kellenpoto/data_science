## Standards for Cross Validation
Students should be able to
 * (H) Use sklearn to select hyperparameters using k-fold cross validation.
 * (MH) Explain why we want a model with an optimal bias-variance tradeoff.
 * (MH) Define a test/train split and explain the importance of unseen data on evaluating a model
 * (MH) Describe the two uses of cross validation or hold-out validation. (model selection and model evaluation)
 * (MH) Implement k-fold cross validation.
 * (M) Define bias, variance and irreducible error.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
