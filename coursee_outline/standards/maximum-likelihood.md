## Standards for Maximum Likelihood
Students should be able to
 * (H) Calculate the MLE solutions for a simple discrete model.
 * (MH) Define maximum likelihood estimation.
 * (MH) Calculate the MLE solutions for a simple continuous model.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
