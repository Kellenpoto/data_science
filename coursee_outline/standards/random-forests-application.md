## Standards for Random Forests Application
Students should be able to
 * (H) Use sklearn RF for regression and classification.
 * (M) Describe number-of-features hyperparameter for RF and state which direction will increase bias, and which will increase variance.
 * (M) Describe how number-of-estimators affects the error of the RF model.
 * (M) Describe the use and meaning of feature importance for tree-based models.
 * (L) Explain and obtain OOB error from RF.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
