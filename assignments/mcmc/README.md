# Bayesian Statistics using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo

While simple Bayesian Statistics can be done by considering all possible hypotheses, dividing the hypothesis space into small pieces, or using conjugate priors, more complex problems require a different approach: Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). With MCMC, model samples various hypotheses such that the probability of considering a hypothesis is equal to its posterior probability.

Python has several libraries for MCMC, including `pymc3`, `PyStan`, and `emcee`. This assignment uses `pymc3`.  Installation instructions can be found <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">here</a> (as well as other documentation).

This is half-day assignment.
