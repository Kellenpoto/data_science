## Standards for Time Series Arima
Students should be able to
 * (M)  Define a stationary time series.
 * (M) Use differencing to make a time series stationary.
 * (M) Use an Augmented Dicker Fuller test to test for stationarity, and explain the null hypothesis.
 * (M) Explain the difference between an AR and a MA series.
 * (M) Explain the terms in an autocorrelation plot.
 * (M) Choose the order of an MA and AR model using an autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plot.
 * (M) Use the Box-Jenkins method to choose the best ARIMA model.
 * (M) Forecast with an ARIMA model in statsmodels.
 * (ML) Use a Box-Cox transformation to reduce heteroscedasticity.
 * (ML) Add seasonality and exogenous variables to forecast with a SARIMAX model in statsmodels.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
