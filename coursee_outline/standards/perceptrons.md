## Standards for Perceptrons
Students should be able to
 * (H) Define the basic parts of a neural network (perceptron, weights, activation, input/output/hidden layers)
 * (H) List advantages and disadvantages of neural networks compared to other machine-learning models.
 * (MH) Build a feed-forward network in numpy using fixed weights and activations.
 * (MH) Use Keras to create a simple MLP for regression or classification.
 * (M) Explain the types and importance of activation functions in neural networks.
 * (ML) Explain how weights are updated using back-propogation and gradient descent.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
