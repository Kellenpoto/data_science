## Standards for Decision Rules
Students should be able to
 * (H) Generate a profit curve from a soft classifier and cost-benefit matrix, and choose the best threshold.
 * (MH) Create a cost-benefit matrix from a description of the costs.
 * (MH) Interpret ROC curves and AUC to evaluate the performance of a model.
 * (M) Explain issues that arise when building a model on datasets that have imbalanced classes.
 * (M) Generate an ROC curve.
 * (ML) Explain common approaches used to balance the classes (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE).
 * (ML) Explain the probabilistic interpretation of ROC AUC.

<br/>Priorities for Standards:
 * H:  Must achieve to graduate
 * MH: Should achieve to graduate
 * M:  Important skill though mastery not necessary
 * ML: Useful skill; encouraged to learn
 * L:  May be useful but not a focus of this program
